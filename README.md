# Cookie-cats
I recently completed a project about analysing results of A/B testing using Python and Pandas. The following code illustrates the key steps I took to clean and analze the dataset.
## Dataset Overview

This dataset comprises A/B test outcomes for Cookie Cats, investigating the impact of relocating the initial gate in the game from level 30 to level 40. Upon installing the game, players were randomly assigned to either gate_30 or gate_40.

The data we have is from 90,189 players that installed the game while the AB-test was running. The variables are:

userid: A unique number that identifies each player.

version: Whether the player was put in the control group (gate_30 - a gate at level 30) or the group with the moved gate (gate_40 - a gate at level 40).

sum_gamerounds: the number of game rounds played by the player during the first 14 days after install.

retention_1: Did the player come back and play 1 day after installing?

retention_7: Did the player come back and play 7 days after installing?

## Code Overview
Import Libraries and Configure Settings
```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
import statsmodels.api as sm
```
Then I imported dataset and checked it for missing values.
```python
data = pd.read_csv('cookie_cats.txt', sep=',')
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(data.head())
print(data.isnull().sum())
```
To make results more reliable it was cleand with IQR method from outliers.
```python
Q1 = df['sum_gamerounds'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['sum_gamerounds'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
df_clean = df[(df['sum_gamerounds'] >= lower_bound) & (df['sum_gamerounds'] <= upper_bound)]
print(f"Num of deleted rows: {len(df) - len(df_clean)}")
```
After I sorted data into two groups: gate_30 and gate_40 and calculated the mean for each group.
```python
group_30 = data[data['version'] == 'gate_30']['sum_gamerounds']
group_40 = data[data['version'] == 'gate_40']['sum_gamerounds']

print(f'Mean for gate_30: {group_30.mean()}')
print(f'Mean for gate_40: {group_40.mean()}')
```
The next step was to make different math test for better understanding this A/B testing results.
The Mann-Whitney U Test was performed to compare the distribution of game rounds between the two groups.
```python
u_stat, p_value = stats.mannwhitneyu(group_30, group_40)
print(f'u_stat: {u_stat}')
print(f'p-value: {p_value}')
```
This section counted the number of players who returned to the game on the 1st day and 7th day after installation, grouped by game version.
```python
returned_1 = df[df['retention_1'] == True].groupby('version').size()
returned_7 = df[df['retention_7'] == True].groupby('version').size()
print(f'returned_1 true: {returned_1}')
print(f'returned_7 true: {returned_7}')
```
The Z-Test checked whether the proportion of returning players differs significantly between the two groups.
```python
z_stat, p_value = sm.stats.proportions_ztest([20034, 20119], [44700, 45489])
print(f'Z-st: {z_stat}')
print(f'p-value: {p_value}')
```
This logistic regression model assessed the influence of game version and game rounds on player retention on day 1.
```python
X = df[['version', 'sum_gamerounds']]
y = df['retention_1']
X = sm.add_constant(X)
logit_model = sm.Logit(y, X)
result = logit_model.fit()
print(result.summary())
```
A similar regression was performed to analyze the effect of the game version and rounds played on 7-day retention.
```python
X = df[['version', 'sum_gamerounds']]
y = df['retention_7']
X = sm.add_constant(X)
lin_model = sm.OLS(y, X)
lin_result = lin_model.fit()
print(lin_result.summary())
```

## Analyzing of results
### Overall Model Performance (1-day 7-day):
#### R-squared (RÂ²): 0.039 and 0.078
The model explains only 3.9% of the variation in 1-day retention and 7.8% in 7-day retention. The remaining parts is influenced by other factors not included in the testing.
#### F-statistic: 1834 and 3820
The models is statistically significant, meaning at least one independent variable has a meaningful impact on 1-day 7-day retention.
### Coefficients and Interpretation (1-day 7-day):
#### const: 0.4218 and 0.161
If all independent variables are zero, the probability of a player returning on day 1 is 42,18% and  day 7 is 16.1%.
#### version: -0.0053, p-value: 0.101 and -0.0076, p-value: 0.002
Moving the gate from level 30 to 40 reduces the 1-day retention probability by 0.53%, though the result is not statistically significant (p > 0.05), but for the 7-day it reduces by 0.76%, which is statistically significant (p < 0.05).
#### sum_gamerounds: 0.0005 and 0.0006
Each additional game round increases the probability of returning by 0.05% on 1-day and by 0.06% on 7-day. This effect is highly significant, indicating that player activity positively impacts short-term and long-term retention.
### Model Diagnostics:
#### Omnibus: 50196.015 and 78019.664
Residuals are not normally distributed, which may affect result reliability.

### Conclusions:
#### Gate Change (version):
The impact of moving the gate is not statistically significant for 1-day, other strategies should be explored to enhance short-term retention. But it negatively impacts 7-day retention, reducing it by 0.76%. Since the effect is pretty big, this suggests the change may hurt long-term player engagement.
#### Player Activity (sum_gamerounds):
Efforts should focus on increasing player activity, as it significantly improves the likelihood of players returning the next day ang week.
### Recommendations:
---
Since the impact of moving the gate is not statistically significant, other strategies should be explored to enhance short-term retention. Focus on increasing player involvement with other features like daily award or game challenges can give more profits than gate changing.
